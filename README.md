The html files were provied, with the css files.  The back end was done by creating a 
server (using python), with the framework flask.  In addition csv was also
used for reading and writing to  save data.  The csv file would save data on the machine which
could be opened by an excel file. The project  uses the server python anywhere meaning project is deployed using Python anywhere.
